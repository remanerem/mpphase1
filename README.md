This is a sales monitoring app where users with permission can review the sales for a certain span of time (in this case, it's a whole year)
and put up comments or work orders depending on what they deem is needed to maintain or improve sales.
This is already connected to a Node.js local server, with the sales on the db, I'm currently working on the js file with the users.
There's no users as of yet so the current username and password is u:Admin and p:p@assword just to access the other parts of the website.
